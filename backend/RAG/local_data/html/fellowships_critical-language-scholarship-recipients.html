</div>
<p>Before enrolling at PSU, Jean-Aime Polneau was attending Bushnell University in Eugene, Oregon, where he had a scholarship to play soccer. Unfortunately, due to an injury he later ended up at PSU.&nbsp;</p><p>Around April 2024, during one of his work shifts, Jean-Aime had a conversation with a medicine delivery driver who was retired from his career as an accountant in the public sector. The two talked about various career options that were available and also about the value of studying languages. this lead Jean-Aime to investigate further. He found a video about Turkish language and listened to what it sounded like. He liked what he heard so much that, in that moment, he made the decision to study Turkish.&nbsp;</p><p>Jean-Aime is also enrolled in the Russian Flagship Program (RFP) and through this program he saw an email about the Criticial Language Scholarship (CLS). This is when he learned that CLS offers more than just a Russian study abroad scholarship. He saw that Turkish was also a critical language, along with several others, and that's when he knew instantly he had to apply. He is now very excited to try authentic Turkish cuisine, have opportunities to speak and practice Turkish daily, and to meet and make friends in another part of the world.&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Summer 2024</u></h3><p><strong>Macie Harreld - Russian</strong></p>

<p>Although Mina wanted to be a linguist when she was younger, she is currently a Social Work major in the BSW program at PSU. Her interest in Swahili began when she enrolled in PSU after transferring from a community college. Already speaking three languages, (English, Farsi, and German), she wanted to try something new and PSU offered it! After enrolling for two years, she was accepted to the CLS Program and will be spending the summer of 2017 in Arusha, Tanzania. Following the CLS Program, Mina has an internship to work with IRCO (Immigrant &amp; Refugee Community Organization) and populations from East Africa. After graduation, Mina wants to work in East Africa surrounding issues of human rights and water resources to help ensure that all people have equal access to clean drinking water.</p><p><strong>Tara Mandella -Russian&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;(bio unavailable)</p><p><strong>Paolo Menuez -Japanese&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;(bio unavailable)</p><h3><u>Summer 2016</u></h3><h3><strong>Megan Burns - Swahili</strong></h3><p>Megan is a Community Development major and a Senior in the Honors College going for a BS.

Michael, whose grandmother is Russian, began learning the language on his own and with a private tutor while he was in the Army. After leaving the service in 2014, he moved back to his home state of Oregon and began investigating ways to further his studies. He was drawn to the Flagship program due to its connection to the Department of Defense, its intensive nature and career-oriented focus. Michael will be traveling to Russia in Summer 2016 on a Critical Languages Scholarship to study at the KORA Center for Russian Language Study in Vladimir. He hopes to eventually use his language skills in the national security field or return to his journalism roots to work as a foreign correspondent.</p><p><strong>Chase Riegel - Russian</strong></p><p>Chase has always been interested in becoming fluent in a foreign language. That combined with a seemingly constant interest in Russia and Russian culture, he chose to learn Russian and it has since become the number one driving force in his life. He started studying Russian with a private tutor during his last few years of high school and started taking Russian courses at PCC after he graduated. From there he was introduced to PSU's Russian Flagship Program and immediately knew that it was for him. Chase studied Russian for two months in Vladimir, Russia on the CLS Program in 2015, and is astonished and delighted to be given another chance to do the same this year. Although his career goals are still developing, Chasee knows he wants a career that will allow him to speak Russian on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Amber Shore - Russian</strong></p><p>Amber is earning a double major in Russian and Applied Linguistics at PSU.
