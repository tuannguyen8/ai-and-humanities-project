<p>Born and Raised in Portland, Maya O'Boyle has always been interested in the world's languages and cultures. This interest led her to pursue Russian language studies as an undergraduate at the University of Oregon, ultimately graduating from PSU with a BA in Applied Linguistics and a TESOL certificate. While at Portland State, Maya discovered her passion for working with adult language learners; she volunteered at PCC in an Adult ESL classroom for her Capstone, co-taught a multi-level ESL course for her Practicum, and worked with Chinese students enrolled in the Maseeh College's Portland Institute Nanjing (PIN). She also worked with the Language, Literacy, and Technology Research Group (LLTR) to examine the digital literacy skills of Oregon WIC participants, and has continued to work for the Office of International Special Programs after graduation.</p><p>As a recipient of a Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship to Bulgaria, Maya hopes to hone her language education skills and strengthen her global perspective. Having never traveled outside the continental United States, the opportunity to live and work in another country through Fulbright will grant her a greater appreciation of the learners she works with<span>—</span>namely their openness and resilience to learn a new language in an unfamiliar environment. At PSU, Maya adopted a philosophy of "English belongs to all who use it."

<p>School of Music &amp; Theater Alumna Melissa Terrall has received a Fulbright García-Robles Open Study/Research Award that will enable her to study Mexican piano repertoire with Dr. David Rodriguez at the Conservatorio Nacional in Mexico City while concurrently auditing master’s courses in the conservatory’s master’s degree program in Mexican music. Terrall received her Bachelor of Music in Piano Performance at Portland State University in 2018, and went on to complete a Master of Music in Piano Performance degree at the University of Kansas in 2022. She works as a private piano teacher and collaborative pianist with soloists, choirs and orchestras. Additionally, she has worked as interim piano professor at Linfield University and Clark College. &nbsp;“During my Fulbright year abroad, I will draw on the communication and performance skills I have developed during my work experience as I conduct research, audit classes, teach master classes in the pre-college conservatory program, and perform solo recitals of piano works by Mexican and U.S. composers around Mexico City.” Terrall said.</p><p>Terrall’s research will focus particularly on Mexican piano repertoire from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a period known for the emergence and development of nationalism in Mexican art music. &nbsp;“I am drawn to the diversity and beauty of Mexican music, and I want to learn to teach and perform these works with a culturally and historically robust approach," Terrall continued. "I want to contribute resources so that this repertoire is more accessible for pianists to perform and teach.” &nbsp;A central focus of her Fulbright year will be to compile an anthology of Mexican piano works for future publication. &nbsp;Terrall joins five PSU faculty members who received Fulbright awards for the 2023-24 academic year, including Tomás Cotik, associate professor of violin in the School of Music &amp; Theater and another PSU student/alumna doing Fulbright research in Germany during 2023-24.</p><p><strong>Kelly Titkemeier - Germany - Research</strong></p>

Kelly will incorporate her research into her thesis, which she plans to defend in Fall 2024.<br><br>Kelly was drawn to researching Johanna Schopenhauer because she identifies with Schopenhauer in an important way: they both changed the trajectories of their lives in their 40s—Schopenhauer began her career as a writer and Kelly began her MA in German Studies. Kelly started her educational journey in 1994 at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, commuting to classes from her hometown of Pemberville, Ohio.

He credits many things to his success in acquiring a Fulbright: his work in International Student and Scholar Services; his TAship; his time studying abroad in Chile; his current academic program; and the many mentors at PSU who supported and encouraged him throughout his education. Jake says he is thrilled for the opportunity to work with and learn from others who have different worldviews and lived experiences.</p><p><strong>Miles Strang - Greenland -&nbsp;English Teaching Assistantship</strong></p>

<p>After getting out the Air Force, Miles says he had no idea what to do. He tried his hand at a number of things, like flight school, being a truck driver, transportation management, and other things. He even completed moving back to his hometown in Humboldt County, California to become a farmer. Thankfully, while in the Air Force, he was fortunate enough to be stationed overseas, specifically in Kyrgyzstan and England. There, he developed a love for foreign language (mainly Russian) and learning about other cultures. Fast forward to 2017, when he transferred to PSU to finish his English degree, and that's when he learned about the Russian Flagship Program. The program helped fill the gap he'd been missing since separating from the military. It helped reignite his interest in foreign language and living abroad to a point where he decided to apply for the Fulbright program to be an ETA in Russia.</p><p>As a guy from the sparsely-populated, redwood-covered hollers of Northern California, where “finding success” is getting a job with health and retirement benefits, he was shocked to learn that he was selected as an alternate for Russia with the Fulbright program. Miles says: "This doesn’t happen to people from my hometown. I was further amazed when the folks at the Danish embassy contacted me and offered me an ETA position in Greenland. Sure, it was nowhere on my map of places that I wanted to go, but hey, so what? It’s a place that not many Fulbrighters have gone, with a unique culture. Plus, it has a lot of what I miss from home; namely the rural environment (population 55,000) full of beautiful landscapes. It should make for a great (albeit frigid) adventure, while also giving me some good experience in a field I want to work in (teaching English)". Lastly, having the opportunity to learn another new language (Danish), makes Miles very happy. From what he understands, he'll be only the second ETA to go to Greenland. It is a developing program, and he's proud to be a part of that. Miles will be working in the capital, Nuuk (population 17,000), with the Greenlandic Ministry of Education and Greenland University.</p><p><strong>Seth Thomas - Jordan -&nbsp;English Teaching Assistantship</strong></p>

<p>Seth studied Arabic and the Middle East at PSU out of a curiosity to better understand his formative childhood years in East Jerusalem. After graduating, he worked as a concierge before realizing his studies were far from over. From 2016-2018 he taught 5th grade English at Pioneers Baccalaureate School in Nablus, Palestine, and sketched many of the buildings and old men in cafes. Since early 2019 he has worked as a Homelessness Prevention Case Manager at Muslim Housing Services in Seattle. where he is grateful for the opportunity to use his Arabic to serve others. During his Fulbright in Jordan, Seth hopes to use urban sketching and comics as a way to connect with students and the local community outside the classroom.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2018-2019 Recipients</strong></h2><p><strong>Katie Conlon -&nbsp;Sri Lanka -&nbsp;Graduate Research Fellowship</strong></p>

<p>Katie credits growing up in the Pacific NW for three traits that have been formative for her life: a deep love for the environment, a curiosity to explore and ask questions, and not being deterred by inclement weather (both physically and metaphorically). Katie merges her passion for asking tough questions and working for environmental sustainability into her PhD focus: Plastic waste management in the Global South. The Fulbright Research Fellowship will allow Katie to complete her PhD fieldwork, which focuses on the case study of the interlinking social factors that contribute to the plastic waste situation in Colombo Sri Lanka, one of the hotspots for plastic waste in South Asia.</p><p>Katie began asking questions about plastic waste and development trajectories as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Mali, West Africa (2005-07; and also a PC Response Volunteer in Guinea 2010-11). What does long-term sustainability mean for a community? How can we change the development discourse to favor social and environmental balance? How can communities in far corners of the globe maintain their culture and environment in the face of development pressures? These questions led her to work and volunteer over the past 15 years in such places as Nepal, Bhutan, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Vietnam, Honduras, Mexico, India, Hawaii, and Japan. Katie completed a Masters in International Peace Studies at Notre Dame, and a BA from the University of San Diego in International Communications and Peace &amp; Justice Studies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Saumya Kini - Japan -&nbsp;Graduate Research Fellowship</strong></p>

<p>Saumya is a Portland native who fell in love with Japanese language at age 13. She holds a Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Oregon (with a minor in Japanese) and a Master of Urban and Regional Planning with a focus in urban design and environmental planning from Portland State University. She is deeply passionate about sustainability, environmental and social justice, and collaborative planning and visioning processes. While starting her career in the Portland urban design and planning community, she learned about local government issues in Japan as a staff member for the PSU Center for Public Service's annual training program for Japanese local government managers. This sparked her interest in learning more about community involvement in urban planning in Japan, and the role of university partnerships in facilitating deeper engagement. During her 2019 Fulbright Graduate Research Fellowship, Saumya will partner with Okayama University's Center AGORA to study community engagement in waterfront park planning and management.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chiara Nicastro - Spain - English Teaching Assistant</strong></p>

<p>Chiara was raised in Northern California in the small wine country town of Healdsburg. Her passion for the world, community involvement, and culture began in high school where she took Cultural Geography courses, joined the Model United Nations club, and volunteered for various non-profits focused on access to education including one serving the Dominican Republic. Her passion for culture and community-building only deepened at PSU, where she&nbsp;completed her undergraduate degree in International Studies with a minor in Women Studies. During her multidisciplinary studies at PSU Chiara challenged herself by studying abroad in Queretaro, Mexico and San Ramon, Costa Rica. While in San Ramon, she volunteered in a junior high school where she taught English as a Second Language, lived with a wonderful&nbsp;host family, and took classes in Spanish, environmental policy, and immigration policy. Upon Chiara’s return, her devotion to cross-cultural learning and education led her to volunteering in the Portland refugee community tutoring refugee children, and teaching through PSU's University Studies Program as a FRINQ Peer Mentor. During her final&nbsp;undergraduate year, Chiara was honored to join the Ronald E. McNair Scholar program at PSU and complete research on the experiences of refugee women in Portland.<br>&nbsp;<br>During her Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship in Madrid, she will work on a project to build cross-cultural relationships developing intercultural education programs in classrooms. Upon completing her Fulbright, Chiara plans to pursue her Master’s in International Development and Peace Policy. Chiara’s long term goal is to earn a Ph.D. and become a professor so she can educate&nbsp;and mentor students underrepresented in higher education and help them overcome obstacles just as she had to as a first generation student with learning disabilities.</p><h2><strong>2017-2018&nbsp;Recipients</strong></h2><p><strong>Megan Dale</strong>&nbsp;- <strong>Bulgaria -&nbsp;English Teaching Assistant</strong></p>

<p>Megan grew up in the suburbs of Seattle and discovered her passion for international service through volunteerism and travel. After traveling South and Central America for a year in order to organically learn Spanish, she realized her passion for International Development, and has focused her studies on the politics and cultures of the world in order to understand the different patterns of development and understand the tools which equip&nbsp;developing countries with the appropriate resources. Through volunteering at David Douglas High School with immigrant and refugee students for two years she realized education is my tool to share with developing countries. She has since networked and raised money for an educational non-profit in Indonesia which she will visit and work with before going to Bulgaria. She plans to return to school for a Masters degree in public service, education or immigrant services.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stephen McNabb</strong>&nbsp;<strong>- Colombia - English Teaching Assistant</strong>&nbsp;</p>

Since graduating, she lived and volunteered in Ecuador where she connected with Range of Motion Project (ROMP), a nonprofit/for-impact organization that provides prosthetic devices to individuals in developing nations who would not receive them otherwise. Her experience working with ROMP illuminated her interest in the dynamic world of orthotics and prosthetics. As a Fulbright researcher she will return to Ecuador to assess the mobility potential of Ecuadorian amputees and help improve the physical potential of this population through data collection and improved technologies. Her work will also contribute to enhanced funding opportunities for amputee research. Conducting research, building community and living in Ecuador energized Emily and left her yearning for more. Now, being granted the opportunity to return, she will further her understanding of the field, strengthen the available amputee research literature, and promote increased advocacy on behalf of disabled individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;She plans to pursue a graduate program to become a prosthetist in the academic year of 2017.</p><p><strong>Flannery Mack&nbsp;- Latvia - English Teaching Assistant</strong></p><p>Flannery grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah.
