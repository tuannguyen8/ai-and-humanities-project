<p>Jessica is a post-baccalaureate student in the Russian Flagship Program at PSU. She previously studied abroad in Kyrgyzstan on the Critical Language Scholarship, and will be returning to Central Asia to complete her capstone year on the Boren and Russian Flagship scholarships. Her interest in Slavic languages and culture was sparked by her love of Russian music, which led her to write her masterâ€™s dissertation on Igor Stravinsky at the University of Oxford. Prior to the M.St., she completed her B.A. at New York University majoring in music performance and minoring in history and art history. She recently presented a paper at the UCLA Undergraduate Conference on Slavic and East/Central European Studies in which she analyzed Russian-language media sources to discuss the use of poetic language in contemporary political discourse. This project, centered on interpreting the capacity of art objects to support political objectives, reflects her research interests in cultural policy in Russian and post-Soviet contexts. She also presented in Russian on Stravinskyâ€™s neoclassical aesthetics at the Language Flagship Russian Culture Online Conference earlier this year. She now eagerly awaits her next opportunity to ride horses on the steppe and explore her new community in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>2018-2019&nbsp;Recipients</h4><p><strong>Ramona Kline -&nbsp;Russianâ€”Almaty, Kazakhstan, 2018-2019</strong></p>
