General Policy</h2><p>The University supports the right of all people to live and learn in a safe and respectful environment that promotes excellence in instruction, research, and public service. The Code of Student Conduct and Responsibility&nbsp;(“Code”) is is designed to protect the freedoms, fundamental rights, and responsibilities of those in the PSU community. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with these principles.</p><ol><li><p>A Student Party whose conduct is determined incongruent with the standards of the University as described in this Code is subject to disciplinary action. The procedures for that action are generally educational in nature and are intended to lead to the preservation of community, self-evaluation, and accountability.</p></li><li><p>The procedures of this Code consider each case individually and without prejudice. Review of alleged conduct code violations shall be done in a prompt, fair, and impartial manner.</p></li><li><p>In addition to the regulations in this Code, all Student Parties must follow the academic and professional standards of all applicable academic units, departments, schools, and colleges.</p></li><li><p>This Code became effective on July 24, 2023 and supersedes all other previous student conduct codes.</p></li></ol><h2>II.

Jurisdiction</h2><ol><li><p>The provisions of this Code apply to all Students and activities on University Premises; during any University Sponsored Activity regardless of location; and to off-campus conduct that has a rational nexus to the University and/or the pursuit of its objectives or that poses a potential threat to the health, safety, or assets of the University or any person associated with the University or substantially impacts any person’s ability to continue their University-related pursuits. Questions regarding jurisdiction will be resolved by the Senior Conduct Officer.</p></li><li><p>Students participating in co-admission programs between Portland State University and other institutions will be accountable to conduct standards at Portland State University regardless of the standards applicable at the other institution and whether or not the other institution is reviewing allegations under their policy.</p></li><li><p>Allegations of certain behavior may be adjudicated within the University’s administrative conduct program as outlined in this Code as well as within any off-campus criminal justice system. Adjudication of allegations of misconduct for Student Parties will occur expediently without regard to the status of any off-campus adjudication.</p></li><li><p>Generally, allegations may be adjudicated up to six months from the date of report of the alleged violation regardless of their current enrollment status. However, in extenuating circumstances, the Senior Conduct Officer may determine that adjudication is appropriate beyond the six-month time limit, in their sole discretion. An adjudicated violation of a prior or inactive student may result in a notation on the permanent record or degree revocation if the Student has separated from the University.</p></li></ol><h2>V.

Whether Title IX Sexual Harassment processes apply may depend on when and where the behavior occurred and the connection of the involved parties to PSU.</p><p>Sexual harassment includes a host of behaviors, only a few of which are defined here. Many of these behaviors involve the absence of Effective Consent, including instances in which a person is incapacitated.&nbsp;Some additional behaviors that constitute Sexual Harassment include the following:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment</strong>: Making submission to unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual’s employment or educational experience.&nbsp;This may include employment, salary, or other benefit changes affecting an employee, or as a basis for educational decisions or benefits affecting a student.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dating Violence</strong>: Sexual violence or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse, on the basis of sex, committed by a person who is in or has been in a “social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature” with the Complainant. PSU determines whether such a relationship exists by considering the Complainant’s statement and the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the people involved.</p></li><li><p><strong>Domestic Violence</strong>: Sexual violence or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse, on the basis of sex, committed by a student who is a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the Complainant, or shares a child in common with the Complainant, or is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the Complainant as a spouse or intimate partner, or is similarly situated to a spouse of the Complainant under the domestic or family violence laws of Oregon. The relationship between the student and the Complainant is more than just two people living together as roommates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fondling</strong>: The touching of the private parts of another person, without the consent of the other person, including instances where the other person is incapable of giving consent because of their age or because of their temporary or permanent mental incapacity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Incest</strong>: Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rape</strong>: The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sexual Assault</strong>: Any sexual act directed against another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim was incapable of giving Effective Consent.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sexual Exploitation</strong>: This means that a student takes non-consensual or abusive sexual advantage of another for their own advantage or benefit or to benefit another person. Examples of Sexual Exploitation include, but are not limited to: invasion of sexual privacy, taking or transmitting photographs of a sexual nature without consent, engaging in voyeurism, exposing one’s genitals in non-consensual circumstances, prostituting another person, or inducing incapacitation with the intent to commit other acts of sexual misconduct.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stalking</strong>: Engaging in a “course of conduct” (two or more acts, including, but not limited to acts in which the student directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means), follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person’s property; on the basis of sex, directed at a specific person, that would cause a reasonable person to fear for the person’s safety, or the safety of others; or suffer substantial emotional distress, which includes anguish that may, but does not necessarily require, medical or other professional treatment or counseling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Statutory Rape</strong>: Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent as defined by the laws of the State of Oregon.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Smoking</strong>: the smoking of any inhalant in university buildings and other unauthorized areas.
